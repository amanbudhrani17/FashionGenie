However, if wearing them and being taller than everyone else bothers you and makes you self-conscious, maybe you could wear shorter heels so that you can still get to wear your favorite shoes but also feel less self-conscious.

It\\'s amazing how many people in clubs look exactly the same—all wearing whatever style dress is currently in season, whether it\\'s flattering on them or not, and enormous heels.I don\\'t really see the point in making such an effort just to look like everybody else.Deciding What To WearObviously, you want to look good, but that doesn\\'t mean you have to wear jeans (although there\\'s nothing wrong with that). Here\\'s how I\\'d decide what to wear:Ignore what\\'s currently in fashion, and instead, work out what looks good onyou.I bought a black lacy skater dress from ASOS a few months ago, and although it looked gorgeous in the picture and it was the right size, it completely hid my waist. It always seems unfair when a style you like doesn\\'t look good on you, but you have to accept it, unfortunately! If you feel confident, you\\'ll look confident.Wear something that won\\'t need adjusting every five seconds. If you\\'re dancing and drinking, the last thing you want is to be checking your boobs haven\\'t fallen out.Don\\'t wear anything too expensive, unless it\\'s a really nice club. You\\'d have to be very brave to wear something white, too—nine times out of ten, you end up getting drink spilt on you in a club, and if it\\'s hot and crowded, you\\'ll probably be covered in other people\\'s sweat as well as your own.Wear something that makes you feel good about yourself. I always enjoy myself more if I\\'m happy with how I look.Clubbing dresses are usually short. However, if you\\'re wearing something that\\'s very revealing up top, you might want to go with a slightly longer skirt—just above the knee, for example. Or you could do the reverse, and have a modest neckline or collar and a shorter skirt.Wearing tights is usually a good idea, even if they\\'re really thin and skin-coloured. They make a huge difference when you\\'re waiting outside for a taxi, and they make your skin look smoother.FootwearI know you asked about dresses, but I think it\\'s also worth thinking about shoes. If you\\'ve got a pair that look gorgeous but are really painful, get gel pads (like Party Feet) for the balls of your feet. Tights come in handy here, too—shoes hurt a lot less when your skin isn\\'t rubbing directly against them!If you\\'re wearing a really striking dress, you can even get away with wearing flats. Last summer I just wore Toms when I went clubbing, which was comfortableandstopped me tripping myself up!Ask Your FriendsIt might be an idea to ask your friends to help you decide on a dress, if they know what sort of club it is. You can also make sure you\\'re all dressed to the same \"level\"—as in, nobody feeling awkward because they\\'re the most dressed up, or wearing the most revealing dress!Ultimately, you want something that\\'ll look good, make you feel good about yourself, and be comfortable enough to allow you to enjoy your night. Have fun!',\n",

Popular websites such as Amazon and eBay don't stock the shoes using that name and this is the common theme for most online retailers. However, this does seem to be a craze at the moment and if it continues it is likely many retailers will start selling them to cash in. It also seems that this is the sort of item that can be made to order - so the right retailer may be able to provide the shoes you seek at the right cost.Are there other options?Well it should be noted that you don't necessarily need shoes made for the specific purpose. In other words, mini-shoes made for something else might work. One of these options are key ring shoes - which are keyrings with shoes attached and in most cases the keyrings can be detached.Here are some results from Amazon:www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&And eBay:www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=keyring+shoes&_sacat=0&amAny other ideas?Well we also feel that shoes made for dolls or for babies might also work.

How has she changed?': [\"Before Madame Loisel lost the necklace, she was selfish and uncaring towards her husband. She was not content with what she had and always wanted more from life. Years later, when she and her husband had worked enough years to pay back the money for the necklace she lost, Madame Loisel has a different character.She realizes the errors in her ways and confesses to Madame Forestier, who was the owner of the necklace that she had worked hard to earn the money back to pay for it. Madame Loisel is sorry for her previous character and becomes a person with better morals, after living for ten years in poverty.The NecklaceMadame Loisel's story is told in the short tale 'The Necklace', written by Guy de Maupassant in 1884. In the tale, Madame Loisel is the poor wife of a clerk, who wishes for a more prosperous life full of riches and luxuries. She is not satisfied with her small home and dedicated husband.Her husband, with good intentions, managed to gain two invitations to a party at which those high in society would be attending. He presents the invitations to Loisel as a gift, but is saddened when she turns them away, claiming not to have a suitable dress to wear. Realizing her distress, he gives her 400 francs to buy a dress, even though he had been hoping to buy a rifle with his savings.After buying a dress she is still not happy, as she has no jewels to wear. Unable to buy any, she borrows from a friend. On the night of the event, from which she gained little enjoyment, Madame Loisel somehow loses the jewels.She and her husband then work ten years of hard labor to save for new jewels to replace the lost ones. She tells the lender the clasp is broken. At the end, she gives the new jewels back, but sees the Madame Forestier in the park and confesses what happened. Then Madame Forestier reveals the jewels were in reality an imitation, and the story is left on that final note.\"],\n",

You can just imagine how many outfits you can use with just these clothes. You're sure to have a new outfit everyday for almost a month.Many men and women often buy very few pants but lots of shirts or blouses. It's because they can use their pants several times without anybody noticing how many pairs of pants they have since all of them almost look the same.However, everybody will easily recognize if you're wearing almost the same shirts or blouses everyday. It's because they come in different sizes, colors, fabrics, and designs. For sure, it won't be long before others can tell how many of them you have.So why are people fond of using pairs of pants and shirts? Here are the reasons why:They're comfortableMany people find it comfortable to wear pants and shirts because they can easily move around wearing them. They don't have to worry about revealing too much skin or look out of style since everybody's using them.FashionableSince when did pants and shirts become out of style? Never! It's because everybody wears them. Young and old alike are fond of using pants and shirts so you don't have to worry about being out of style or be labeled as a fashion victim. You can buy or wear those that have trendy designs and cuts to make your whole look attractive.AffordableWhy spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on designer clothes when you can buy a nice pair of pants and a shirt and still look hot?

       " 'What Brands Of Dresses Does Monique Wear On Her Bet Show?': [\"Monique won't reveal exactly where she gets the stylish frocks she wears on her popular Bet show. However, many people love the dresses, and they really wish they could find out who designs them. If you're looking for a fun blog devoted to Monique's dresses, and how to get the same look with some inexpensive copycat designs, you may want to visit the following link:http://www.thecurvycoach.com/1227/dresses-inspired-by-monique-on-the-monique-show/.Many of the dresses Monique wears are designed to flatter a curvy body - they are form-fitting, without being too tight. Often, these gowns have a deep V-neck which calls attention to pretty curves, and give the whole body a leaner, slimmer look. Many women with curvier bodies look great in V-neck designs, so consider a V-neck wraparound dress (or blouse and skirt) to get the same sort of chic and fashionable look.Dresses like these can be accessorized with stylish high heels, long, beaded necklaces, and cool drop earrings. Hair may be worn up or down with a Monique-style dress. Sometimes, long layers parted in the middle, or in a deep side part, can be very flattering on curvy women, as they visually slim down the contours of the face.Other Tips For Dressing Like Monique• Wear prints in fun, splashy tropical colors! These sorts of prints keep the eye moving around, so people who see you in the dress won`t focus on just one part of your body. Finding a print that flatters is as easy as looking for exciting floral or abstract prints that aren`t too loud. Tropical pastels, such as pale yellow and orange, will be perfect for the warm-weather months - deeper colors and thicker, warmer fabrics will be better for cooler weather. Add a cardigan to give your outfit a layered look - a fitted cardigan with three quarter sleeves would be an excellent choice - find a sweater in a neutral color that will go with anything.The best way to find Monique-inspired dresses is simply to watch her programs and remember details about her dresses - note dress lengths, accessories, and shoes that are used to accessorize the dress designs - then, find similar styles at local malls or fashion outlets. Sometimes, you can get great deals on online auction sites, such as eBay.\"],\n",

       " 'How To Make A Peacock For A Fancy Dress Competition?': [\"Making a peacock costume for a fancy dress party is actually a lot easier than it might seem at first. The only tricky part of the task is gathering all the peacock feathers, as you will need quite a lot of them. You will also need one yard of blue fabric, one yard of elastic that measures one inch a needle and thread, glue designed especially for crafting, a blank white mask, glitter, sequins, ribbons and cardboard.Step one. Lay your one yard length of fabric flat on the floor and then lay the length of elastic straight along one of the edges of your piece of fabric. Carefully, fold the cloth over the elastic and sew this fold over using your thread and needle. This will encase your elastic inside your fabric. Check that this will fit the person wearing the costume by wrapping it around their waist and pulling the elastic tight.Step two. Using craft glue, attach the peacock feathers to the edge of the skirt. Try and buy as many as possible to make the skirt look as full as possible. When you glue on the feathers, place the piece of cardboard inside the skirt to stop both sides of the skirt from sticking together. Arrange the feathers around the back half of the skirt by placing the feathers about ¼ of an inch apart and hold them in place for about a minute until the glue has completely dried. Repeat this process until the skirt looks like a peacock's tail.Step three. Decorate the blank mask with the sequins, glitter and colored glue so that it closely resembles a peacock. Glittery materials are perfect for decorating a peacock mask because they are such proud and flashy creatures. Blank masks are commonly found in most craft shops. Let the mask dry completely before you or someone else puts it on.\"],\n",

With every pair sold, TOMS donates a new pair of shoes to a child in need. The lightweight shoes are based on the Argentine alpargata design. The company was founded in 2006 by Blake Mycoskie, an entrepreneur from Arlington, Texas who was shocked by the lack of shoes available for children when he visited Argentina. Mycoskie decided to focus his attention on shoes due to a serious disease called podoconiosis, which is a debilitating and disfiguring disease also known as \"Mossy Foot\". It is a soil-transmitted disease caused by walking in silica-rich soil. This causes one\\'s feet to swell along with many other health implications. Shoes are the most basic solution to many of these health risks. Not only are shoeless children susceptible to health risks but they also are not permitted to go to school without footwear. Mycoskie emphasizes that his company\\'s goal is to not only give shoes, but to also educate others on the importance of wearing shoes. Over 1,000,000 pairs of shoes have been given to children under the One for One movement since TOMS launched in 2006. The canvas shoes have been given to children in more than 20 countries worldwide, including the United States (Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi and Florida), Argentina, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Guatemala, Haiti, and South Africa. TOMS are sold at more than 500 stores nationwide and internationally, including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Whole Foods, which features styles made from recycled materials.',\n",

In fact, the style is still gaining in popularity with both men and women searching for the perfect pair of skinny jeans.White skinny jeans are actually the most fashionable color and the best brands can be found at many retailers and online boutiques. White is the most versatile color and women find them the easiest to accessorize.The deciding factor for most people when shopping for white skinny jeans is of course the cost. The higher-end stores sell some of the most popular brands. Stores such as Bergdorf Goodman sell Vince; Ralph Lauren, Rock and Republic, and Citizens of Humanity ranging in price from $169 to $235.Mid-level priced stores have products at about half the cost. Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Guess and Levis are available at Macy’s for anywhere from $50 to $75. This is a consistent price range for other retailers as well. In the budget and big-box stores, while many offer skinny jeans, they don’t carry the jeans in white. K-Mart is the only one consistently stocking Freestyle Janica, Bongo and Resilience white skinny jeans.However, the number of online sellers of white skinny jeans is enormous. Manufacturers of Acne, Phillip Lim, Diesel, H&M, TopShop and Stella McCartney all have websites that sell their own brand of white skinny jeans.

       " 'How Do I Spot A Fake Gucci T Shirt?': ['The most obvious way to spot a fake t-shirt, or counterfeit good of any kind, is the price. For an authentic Gucci t-shirt, you should expect to pay one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, even four hundred dollars from a reputable dealer. Even at a discounted price, it is highly unlikely that you will find an authentic, new Gucci t-shirt for less than 75 dollars. So if you see a guy with a stall selling \"Gucci\" t-shirts for five, 10, 20 dollars, you should steer clear if you don\\'t want to end up with a fake.Another indicator of counterfeit Gucci t-shirts is the label. In authentic t-shirts, the label on the inside of the collar should be black with white text printed onto it. The size should be found on a small, separate label at the collar, on top of the label with \"Gucci\", \"made in Italy\" and (maybe) washing instructions printed on to it. Also, check the actual text printed onto the label. On genuine Gucci t-shirts, the text on the labels is equally spaced and centrally positioned on the label, and the letters should be smooth and rounded. If the stitching of the label looks poor quality or jagged, or the text is too close together, then the product you are looking at might be a fake. If the fabric, detailing or the t-shirt as a whole looks shabby or poorly executed, steer clear. Gucci t-shirts are always made carefully using high quality fabrics.If you\\'re looking online at sites such as eBay, and you\\'ve come across a t-shirt which you think may be a fake, don\\'t be afraid to ask the seller questions. If the shirt and its seller are genuine, then you should be provided with honest feedback in a friendly, open way. If the seller becomes defensive, is not helpful or does not respond at all, don\\'t bother buying their product, as it could be a fake.'],\n",

Traditional clothing for Tswana men includes tribal feathers and tunics, whilst women of the tribe are historically required to keep their thighs covered with long dresses and cloaks. However, as the tribe becomes increasingly more modernized, the number of women wearing tight pants and short skirts is rising - particularly in less-rural areas of the land. This has received widespread criticism from many traditionalist members of the tribe, but the movement towards a more modern era of clothing appears to be inevitable.Traditionally, many Tswana women also wear thin headscarves and neck rings as part of their cultural dress. Because of the hot weather conditions throughout the duration of the year in Southern Africa, both Botswana men and women use fine fabrics to make their clothes to prevent them from overheating. It is not uncommon for men to be topless, but women are required to cover most of their bodies for religious reasons and so have to make do with lightweight materials to keep as cool as possible in the dry, humid weather.The textiles industry is quite prominent amongst the Tswana tribe, with most families making their own clothing from raw materials such as cotton and linen. Young children are wrapped in handmade swaddling when they are first born and later upgrade to similar clothing to their parents when they can walk and work. Although many Tswana people are not wealthy enough to send their children to school, those that do aren't usually required to wear uniform. School and work clothing in Botswana and amongst members of the Tswana tribe is essentially the same as every day wear.\",\n",

It was quite often worn with sturdy shoes or short boots, and hair was typically short and straight. Some actresses like Julia Roberts helped make the grunge look fashionable.This gradually slimmed down to a more fitted look, with flowing skirts and dresses becoming more popular.

They can come in the shape of objects and animals, but there is no particular meaning to any of them. However they are being banned in a number of schools due to the rumour that was made online by some students that certain colours can mean different sexual orientations, or that they can mean that certain sexual acts have be done comparing on what colours that are worn. However these are just rumours made up by a number of high school children. And the banning of silly bands in a number of schools is due to the trouble that these rumours have caused.Silly Bandz are rubber bands made of silicone rubber formed into shapes including animals, objects, numbers, and letters. They are distributed by BCP Imports and are normally worn as bracelets. Silly Bandz retail in packages with themes like princesses or animals. A pack of 24 sells for about $5 and packets of 12 for about $2.50. Similar shaped silicone bands are also available under other brand names from a variety of companies.On a wrist, they function like a regular bracelet, and when taken off they revert to their original shape. They are often worn many at a time and are traded like other collectibles. They can also be used for their original intent as a regular rubber band.The original shaped silicone rubber bands were created in 2002 by the Japanese design team Passkey Design, Yumiko Ohashi and Masonar Haneda. They made the bands in cute animal shapes to encourage sustainability by discouraging people from treating the rubber bands as disposable. Sold under the brand name Animal Rubber Bands, they won the Best Design award at the 2003 Japanese National Competition. These bands were not widely distributed in the United States, but in 2005 they were local hits in Guilford, Connecticut and at the Design Store at the New York City Museum of Modern Art.Robert Croak, owner of Toledo, Ohio-based BCP Imports, known for distributing the Livestrong wristbands, encountered the bands on a business trip and decided to re-purpose them as a toy by making them larger and thicker, and marketing them as a kids' fashion accessory.\",\n",

       " 'What To Wear With Grey Shoes?': ['When you’re picking out outfits to go with gray shoes, you want cooler tones. Blues, greens, purples, and of course black and white and gray. Pairing gray shoes with a mostly black or dark blue outfit gives it a little pop of lightness and personality. If you wear a lot of black, the gray shoes offer a non-black option that matches the aesthetic but gives you some variety to work with.You may actually want to steer clear of matching gray bottoms to these shoes – the match has to be absolutely perfect for it to look deliberate, and if it doesn’t look deliberate it just sort of looks like a clumsy wardrobe choice that resulted in a misbalance in your outfit.Gray shoes are an excellent choice if you want to rock some patterns; the shoes act as a balance that is both neutralizing and cheerfully encouraging. As long as you don’t overdo it – you only really need one pattern with this kind of outfit, not three patterns and a dozen statement piece accessories – you can achieve a wonderful and visually pleasing balance between your top and bottom.Remember that you can mix your neutrals! If you’ve got a solid capsule wardrobe your foundation pieces should consist of a lot of neutral tones that you can safely wear out and about with your gray shoes without having to stress too much about it.WHAT BELT TO WEAR WITH GRAY SHOESThere’s a whole system for knowing what belt you’re supposed to wear with what shade of shoe, and it can be a bit overwhelming. The easiest way out is to wear a matching gray belt, but that can mean having to balance the rest of your outfit to look appropriate with both the gray shoes and the gray belt.Although typically it’s a no-no, most people won’t scrutinize too hard if you choose to wear a dark brown belt with gray shoes, and you’re always safe if you just go with a simple black belt with a silver buckle. Grey shoes are the perfect item to pair with a belt with a pattern, like a black tooled leather belt with white accents.If it fits with the rest of your outfit, this is actually a rare pair of shoes that can be paired with a white belt for a clever and flashy combination. The main thing you want to avoid wearing is a light brown belt, which is just close enough in tone to be in competition but just different enough to clashWHAT FORMAL CLOTHING TO WEAR WITH GRAY SHOESIf you’re a person who wears suits or dress shoes to the office every day, we’d advise that gray shoes are an excellent addition to a wardrobe, but maybe not the ideal starting point. If you wear black men’s dress shoes every day, nobody is going to notice; the same cannot be said for gray shoes. If you already have a nice pair of black shoes and a nice pair of brown shoes, however, gray shoes are an excellent next step for bringing a little variety and aplomb to your presence in the board room.You can wear light gray dress shoes with a navy suit or a black suit, or a very dark charcoal suit. These rules also apply for weddings, where you can up your dapper quotient by adding a matching gray vest to your ensemble to really balance out the lightness of the shoes with the heaviness of the suit and pants. Alternately, you could go for a vest that matches your jacket and elect to wear a light gray tie on a white dress shirt.WHAT ACCESSORIES TO WEAR WITH GRAY SHOESGray shoes are particularly forgiving when it comes to accessories. Unlike blue shoes, which count as a statement piece in their own right and require your fashion arithmetic account for them when you’re keeping yourself from committing the fashion sin of wearing too many statement pieces at once, gray shoes are neutral enough that you still have room to add more flair on top of them.You’re freed from the obligation of staying matchy-matchy with these shoes – you could wear a little bit of silver or gray in your watch strap or in a necktie or piece of jewelry, but you actually will look better with a little color instead of sticking to pure gray. This is especially true of outfits that are comfortably neutral or uses dark, cool tones – you can confidently rock your favourite accessory as long as it matches the rest of your ensemble.Pictures quoted from Fool’s DayFunny Socks',\n",

The film has become extremely popular as a symbol of British culture and it is often remembered for its famous Mini chase scene through Turin and for the opening scene where Roger Beckermann is driving the Lamborghini Muira through the Swiss Alps. Michael Caine starred in the film and is often quoted for the famous line in the film 'You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off'. This line was voted as the best movie one-liner in a 2003 poll.There has recently been a re-make of The Italian Job which came out in 2003 starring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham and Edward Norton. Although this was also a hit at the box office, the rotten tomatoes ratings have favoured The Italian Job of 1969 with 83% whereas the modern version only received 73%.\"],\n",

Either their own, or their own AND the secular community which surrounds it.This distinction is relevant because the robes of monks versus friars are different.\\xa0 Also, the robes of the different orders of both friars and monks also differ in both color and style.\\xa0 Some have hoods, some don\\'t; some are gray, some are black, some are white, some are brown, etc.However, in all cases -- be they monks or friars, and regardless of the color and/or style of their robes -- they all tend to wear them, and the reason is really quite simple:\\xa0 Because Jesus commanded it of the disciples whom the monks and -- particularly the friars\\xa0-- emulate.For around a hundred years during the last half of the 12th century, and the first half of the 13th, as the four great orders of friars (Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites and Augustinians) were formed to meet the urgent challenge of spiritual decline, urban growth, and the rapid spread of heresy in Europe, they all wished to follow the instruction of Jesus as found in Matthew 10:8-10, wherein Christ commanded his disciples to go out and preach, carrying no money or provisions, and wearing no fancy clothes or shoes.\\xa0 Christ said:\\xa0 \"[8]Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment. [9]Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, [10]no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for labourers deserve their food.\"St. Francis of Assisi took these words most seriously in his formation of the\\xa0 Franciscans, or Order of Friars Minor, in 1208; and\\xa0approved a year later in 1209 by Pope Innocent III.\\xa0 He dressed in a robe of rough or course gray wool... Something we know because one of his robes is preserved in the convent at Assisi.Throughout the years, different orders -- including even different branches of Franciscans -- sought to either differentiate and distinguish themselves from other orders, or to symbolize something, by departing from St. Francis\\'s gray colored robe.\\xa0 However, in 2000, the leaders of the modern Franciscans worldwide announced a plan to return to the gray colored robe of St. Francis.Father Enzo Fortunato, the spokesman for the head convent at Assisi, said the change was not an aesthetic decision, adding that it would reflect \"a profound return to our roots and a strong message of unity\".However, some Franciscan orders will have nothing to do with it.\\xa0\\xa0 For example, though a small number of them\\xa0have worn\\xa0gray or black robes\\xa0for centuries, most members of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (aka, simple, the Capuchin friars) throughout the world have worn coffee brown robes since their founding somewhere between 1525 and 1528; and virtually all of them have said, in no uncertain terms, that that won\\'t be changing anytime soon.There is, then, not-insignificant disagreement among the different orders in what color (and sometimes also what style) the robes should be; but they all agree that, pursuant to Christ\\'s commandment, they should be wearing at least some kind of robe.______Gregg L.

       " \"What Is The Average Diameter Size Of A Men's Watch?\": [\"Typically, the diameter size of a men's watch will be about 30 to 35 mm (millimeters), or about one and a half inches. Sometimes, men opt for larger, bolder watches, such as the glamorous, diamond-encrusted piece created by celebrity jewelry, Jacob The Jeweler, who makes showpieces for rap star and rockers.Finding the right watch is about seeking out quality and then looking for a design that suits the tastes and preferences of the wearer.How To Choose The Right Men's Watch• To begin, consider the price point of a watch - knowing how much money can be spent on a timepiece can help to narrow down choices. For example, in the budget range, a Timex sport design that is rugged, durable, and reliable will be a fine choice for many men; however, this type of inexpensive watch may not work with certain outfits, such as suits and formal attire.• If money is no object, designer timepieces with excellent resale value, such as Breitlings or Tag-Heuers, can be investments that also improve a man's image and overall appearance. Some people do consider wristwatches to be status symbols; in fact, certain people may glance at a person's watch to gauge their financial situation, or their place is society. Of course, such judgments can be superficial and incorrect.• Look for quality by choosing a timepiece crafted from quality materials - for example, steer clear of fake Rolexes sold on the street, no matter how good they look. Instead, seek out the best quality and warranty you can afford - look up product ratings online and compare different styles - you should consider comfort, durability, and style.Finally, look for a watch you will really enjoy wearing; while many people have abandoned their wristwatches in favor of checking the time on their iPhones, there is still something masculine and appealing about wearing a fine watch.\"],\n",

A lead retailer of Levi clothing, Just Jeans offers hugely competitive rates on a range of legitimate products from the famed denim manufacturer. Shipping is also relatively inexpensive because the company only serves customers from Australia and New Zealand. To be precise, orders of $120 or more are absolutely free, whilst any purchase that's smaller than this will cost you $10 on top of whatever the cost of your item/s is.Another excellent Levi Jeans internet wholesaler for you to look at is Hallensteins, found atwww.hallensteins.com. Here you can find a vast array of prime Levi goods - including the stonewash jeans range: A wonderfully timeless classic. You'll be pleased to hear that all deliveries from this website are free of charge for residents of both Australia and New Zealand - yet another added bonus for fans of the retro yet incredibly stylish Levi Jeans clothing range.Websites such aswww.americanjeans.comandwww.thejeanking.comalso offer a one-of-a-kind range of original Levi goods. However, both of the above are international sites, which means that shipping prices can prove to be considerably higher than those charged by websites which serve New Zealand and Australia only. To combat this problem and keep your fees down to a minimum, though, The Jean King promises to sell Levi products for up to 50% less than the recommended retail price would dictate as being standard for such high-quality, luxury goods.\"],\n",

A waistcoat is a sleeveless under-jacket, named waistcoat in the UK and many other commonwealth countries, but referred to simply in the US and Canada as a vest. These pieces of clothing are usually worn as part of formal attire, or as the third piece of a lounge suit.Undershirts are normally worn under a shirt are commonly known as vests in the UK and many other commonwealth countries, a singlet in Australia and Asia, and is usually in the form of a t-shirt of sleeveless top.The term vest can refer equally as accurately to sports clothing such as tanks tops or padded sleeveless jacket popular for hunting, known commonly as a hunting vest. A vest which carries a profusion of external pockets for carrying fishing tackle and other such paraphernalia is know as a fishing vest, and the term 'jerkin' is also used to refer to this kind of sleeveless outdoor coat.Other names include sweater vests - also know as slipovers, sleeveless sweaters or tank tops (which may also refer to a type of sleeveless shirt), and a banyan, which is a type of traditional Indian ware.The word 'vest' comes from the French 'veste' (jacket, sport coat), the Italian 'vesta/veste' (robe, gown) and the Latin vestis. It is believed that the sleeveless garment worm by men beneath a coat was first made popular by King Charles II of England, since an entry from the diary of Samuel Pepys (dated October 8th 1666) declares that 'the King hath yesterday, in Council, declared his resolution of setting a fashion for clothes...

This, along with the sleek design of the watch and Breitling signature, makes the Chrono-matic watch unique.• Olivia BensonOlivia Benson is a fictional character on the drama show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. The character is played by the American actress Mariska Hargitay. Her first appearance is on the episode 'Payback', in which she appears as an investigator looking into a sex crime. It is discovered partway through the series that Olivia herself was born due to the rape of her mother, who later dies in the series. Throughout the series she is shown to be an investigator of high standing, who works hard to ensure her emotions don't influence the job at hand.• Law and Order: Special Victims UnitLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit is an American drama about a New York police department and the detectives working within it.

I used to be crazy about authenticity and quality etc. Now after spending fortune on these bags I realized it was a waste of money. And you ask me why? Because I can easily purchase good replica and use that bag same way I use authentic and keep the money in my pocket. I would rather donate this money to Haiti or Israel or India for a good cause. Will that anyhow affect my status? NO absolutely not. I still make money I still have things I have. THe only difference is I have a chanel bag for $300 bucks. I'm grateful to my friend for opening my eyes. Guess why no one bothers to make replica on Tory Burch or Cola Haan bags. Because they are affordable and there is no point to make the replicas. Are these bags anyway worse in quality. Authentic Tory burch or Authentic Gucci, Absolutely not. Please if you want to buy authentic bag don't fool yourself and be aggravated. Keep your central nervous system in relaxed mode.You knew you getting ripped off so don't exaggerate here. NO POINT.\",\n",

The genuine bags are made from top quality materials not the stuff you find on the high street, so if a so called 'authentic' bag is being sold for probably less than what it costs to make then surely you cannot be getting the real deal!I was tempted but I want the real thing and I don't want to be ripped off.

       "  \"Hi there guysQuite a weird thing happened last night! I usually go on to the site and speak to customer services trying to get them to 'CRACK' and they always reply saying that they are authentic, but then last night around 12:00 I mentioned something about the LV Bellevue GM bag and the person just said, 'YES IT IS A HIGH REPLICA'. So I then questioned and asked why they claim that their products are authentic, and the persons reply was that 'SOME BAGS ARE AUTHENTIC AND SOME ARE REPLICA'.But then this morning I asked again and they said this is not true? There is something VERY strange with this site! I have bought from here, a LV wallet, which was fine but, a Gucci bag ..www.paybags.comI would stay away from.. I am having it returned too. It was disgustingly big, and looked nothing like the picture.I have also noticed how they use the pictures from the actual authentic sites, For example (for those wanting to check themselves) The Bellevue GM. On the Paybags site, the customer service said they took the photos themselves, but then on the official Louis Vuitton\\xa0\\xa0site, the picture was exactly the same for this item. They have also called me and it was broken english and such a bad connection! I could hardly hear anything, and I just told them to email me instead because it was that poor! I have also wondered about the prices, even if they were overstock, you would still sell them closer to the price, and what was also quite strange, is how all the prices seem to be around the same. I know that Chanel handbags can go for thousands, yet this site sells them at around £200, this just does not make sense! Please, can somebody who has received from this site, go and ask a shop or somebody whether these are replicas? Thanks, Aysha\",\n",

So why they just become a reliable company which sells high quality replicas and accept refunds - good reputation can make them more money than occasionally fooling one or two people...To be honest I do not understand ppl paying so much for design bags I would value them for £200-400. I do owe a Gucci and a Fendi bag which I got as presents from my boyfriend (notably Italian ;p)\\xa0and\\xa0to know that they are sooo expensive I would happily return them (of course if they didn't have so much sentimental value\\xa0to me) because £1000 they're valued for is design+quality+human vanity with a ratio 15%-25%-60%.\",\n",

They are checked by security people each time they leave their work ... They're searched just to check if they are not carrying out items out the premises...So you see how strong are the rules when it comes to luxury items, that's why there is no way to have genuine items at bargain prices such as the ones on PayBag website.The only way to shop authentic Louis Vuitton or Hermes products is to go and buy them out from their official boutiques!!!!As we say here 'C'est la vie!'

       " 'What Shoes To Wear With A Coral Dress?': ['Coral is the perfect colour for summer and, depending on the dress, you can wear a huge variety of shoes to go with it. If the dress has any other colours on it, then it usually works well to wear this colour in your accessories. If the dress has white detailing around the neck, or gold buttons for example, it would work well to wear this colour in your shoes. If there is no other colour in the dress then classic shades of tan or nude will work well.Avoid dark colours such as black as they will stand out too strongly against the dress and never match your dress to your shoes. It would be too much of the same colour if you matched from head to toe.It is a good idea to match your shoes to your bag to ensure you look well co-ordinated and gold jewellery works well with coral, particularly if you have tan to give it a summery, vibrant look.If you are still unsure of what to wear and how to co-ordinate your outfit, try using a search engine to find what other people have worn. ‘Google Images’ is a great tool to use to do this. It will bring up pages of people wearing coral dresses and many of these will be celebrities who have personal stylists to ensure they look perfect.If you are lucky, there will be a full length photograph which will include the shoes, bag and jewellery which you can take inspiration and tips from. There may even be examples of celebrities who ‘got it wrong’ and wore something which did not match and you will clearly be able to see which shoes to avoid.Remember, not only must your shoes match your dress, but they must also match the occasion. Make sure they are suitable for whatever situation you will be wearing the dress in.',\n",

       "  \"Many different colors of shoes pair well with coral dresses, but taking into account the will help make your entire ensemble look that much better. Combine that knowledge with the correct style of shoe, and you'll have a look that is an instant winner.Coral HuesNot all coral is created equal, as the hue plays a large role in the overall look of the dress. Some hues to consider include:Orange: Some dresses labeled coral actually have a true orange undertone to them. You'll notice this undertone by the boldness of the color and its general energetic feel.Peach coral: Peach-coral styles are pale and delicate. The hallmark of this shade is in its romantic, soft quality.Salmon: Salmon shades of coral are at once bold, yet highly feminine and soft. These shades enhance the more seductive nature of the body, but in a understated way.Hot coral: This shade combines all of the characteristics listed above, save for the romantic, delicate quality. Hot coral evokes a seductive, powerful, and energetic vibration.Styles of ShoesThe great news is that no matter what the color of your dress, you'll find a shoe style and color to fit. First up , styles of shoes. Here, you're looking at:Strappy sandalsFlat sandalsStacked heelsPumpsCreate the Perfect PaletteWhen dealing with the color of the shoe, reach for shades of :GoldThis is a great color with coral because it conveys a certain sense of majesty to your look. It gives the appearance of floating on air. If you need to look stately and regal, step into a pair of strappy, gold heels.Beige/TanNudes are the earthy cousin of gold. Beige and tan give a similar feeling of the regal-ness of the color gold, but with a more sultry Venusian bent. If you want to keep your look grounded, opt for nude pumps.True YellowAh, sunny yellow! Yellow brings a smile to just about everyone's face. This is a good color to reach for if you want an instant pick me up, or want to pump up the energy of the room.RedCommanding and bold, red says you are ready to get your flirt on. Overtly strong, sexy and commanding, red focuses all eyes on you. Choose this color when you want to stand out, or if you are tired of blending in.Navy BlueBlue and coral combine perfectly if you want to be flirty, yet serious. Coral is a feminine color, but navy blue will ground your look in a certain seriousness. This proves especially true with a substantial heel.BlackBlack is always grounding, and can come on strong. Wear this color shoe to convey authority, and leadership. This is a good choice if you are wearing your coral dress to a work function.WhiteWhite, similar to black, goes with everything. However, consider pairing your dress with this color if you are attending a function that is associated with purity, for example, a christening, bat mitzvah or another religious function. Additionally, this color combo works well for fundraising events.PurplePurple and coral work well to give off a fun, party vibe. Be careful with what shade of purple you choose; stick with true and royal purple. Lavender shades and the like might appear anemic and odd.Style of DressAlong with hue, the style of the dress also impacts what kind of shoe you'll wear. Some of the styles can include:Soft and floaty: Think feminine and graceful, as if walking on a cloud. This category also includes maxi dresses. Floaty dresses look best with either strappy heels or flats. Stay away from stacked heels, since they'll look clunky.Structured and form fitting: These dresses skim the body, and are form fitting without feeling tight. Conveying a certain amount of power to the wearer, this style feels almost business-like in nature. These styles can handle a more substantial shoe like pumps and stacked heels.Short and flirty: This is a young, party look. The vibration of this style is celebratory and youthful.You'll want a delicate heel here as well since you'll want to keep the flirty atmosphere of the dress. Think stilettos and the like. You can tone the flirtatiousness of the dress down by pairing the look with kitten heels.A Note on AccessoriesRegardless of the hue of the dress, and the style of the shoe, you'll want to keep an eye on your accessories as well. When it comes to choosing colors and styles, keep your jewelry in the same family of your shoes. This doesn't mean that you have to play the matchy-matchy game, but, your accessories should be within the same color and weight family as your shoes.quoted from Fool’s DayFunny Socks\",\n",

Is it patterned? If it is, you may wish to go for a show that looks a bit planer as not to draw attention away from the pattern on the dress. The opposite also applies, if your dress is plain or block color, you may want to go for a shoe that has patterns or detail on it. If the dress is block color, you could always go for block color shoes to complement the look, perhaps in a contrasting color.Have a think about what accessories you already have before you buy the shoes. You don't want to have to buy lots of new accessories to match both the shoes and the dress.Maybe get a shoe that goes with other outfits that you own so that you can mix and match what you wear with them, this way you will get more wear out of your new shoes and they will be more cost efficient.Have a think about what the occasion is and how long you will spend on your feet. You don't want to have sore feet from them being too high if you have to stand up for hours. You may also want to have a think about what time of year it is, open toe shoes are not great in the depths of winter, you will have very cold toes, while boots are not a great idea in the middle of summer.Choose a color that you love, and it's always a good idea to take the dress with you when shoe shopping so that you can see what the colors look like together before you buy.\",\n",

A hoodie is easily tied around one\\'s waist in a pinch; d n b events tend to get uncomfortably warm and you will likely want to remove your outerwear while remaining able to keep an eye on it if at a crowded party or club.

This is particularly the case in customer or client related organizations and the service sector in general. Going for an interview in particular demands a reasonably smart appearance, as first impressions do tend to go a long way towards success. In view of this, here are a few handy hints and tips how to dress smart:Males - WorkTrousers should be black, grey or blueShirts should preferably be white, pale grey or pale blueSocks should either match the trousers or be a darker shadeShoes should be black and cleanIf wearing a tie is required, there are two possible options:Conservative choice: Blue, grey, a combination of checks and linesFlamboyant choice: Contrasting colors, such as red etcSuits should be either black or navy blue. The best bet is to have one of each and wear them with different combinations of shirts and ties.Males - Casual SmartKhaki trousers and light blue or contrast checked shirts are a great conservative look, while jeans and a linen jacket are a little more flamboyant. Those in less than good shape should avoid tight clothing at all cost.Females - WorkA business suit consisting of a blazer and either pants or a skirt are usually the norm, although dresses are fine as long as they are comfortable to wear. Color choices depend on taste, but the rule of matching shoes etc to the outfit still remains.Females - Casual SmartAgain, the choices are endless. The main thing to remember is to trust one's instinct and be comfortable in what is being worn.A final tip for everyone: Accessorize, but keep it low key.\"],\n",

As it is not stated where you live I cannot give you information about local stores that will sell this product near you.The most reputable online shop that sells Adonna clothing is eBay.com. EBay has a dedicated Adonna page for you to look through a large range of clothing including pajamas and underwear. The clothes can be bought new from eBay or are traded second hand by other eBay users; although I can appreciate that second hand may not be desirable in terms of underwear.Another good website offering Adonna clothing and underwear is JC Penney's online store. They offer many Adonna items, although most seem to be nightgowns and pajamas again.Adonna does not yet have a dedicated online store for its clothing, and this makes sourcing its clothes much harder than other clothes brands.Most online websites that appear on the surface to offer Adonna underwear are in fact just price comparison websites or links to other advertising. This is why caution should be taken when trying to search for and buy Adonna clothing online.There is one online shop that seems to offer an extensive range of Adonna underwear so the first port of call for Adonna underwear should be Lavinia Lingerie. Their dedicated Adonna underwear page can be accessed by clicking this link:http://search.lavinialingerie.com/adonna-panties--list.Lavinia Lingerie offer Adonna underwear in a variety of styles and sizes to suit most tastes.

This includes sizing of the frame to ensure a good fit. Each item is then supplied with a range of accessories, according to specifications and customer requirements, as well as a user manual.User ManualThis user manual should, in theory, include instructions as to whether adjustment of the frame is possible and, if so, how adjustment of the frame can be implemented. If no manual was supplied, there is a good chance that this is not an original pair of Oakley sunglasses, unless, of course, they were bought second hand. In this case, the previous owner may be able to supply the manual or give an idea how to make the necessary adjustments.Too Costly to Take a RiskUnfortunately, it has not been able to locate a manual or any other instructions on how to adjust the frame of an Oakley X Metal Juliet anywhere else. Even so-called instructional videos generally turn out to be more or less pure adverts.As the price of these sunglasses is simply too high to risk potential damage by simply having a go, the best possible course of action would be to return to the supplier of the sunglasses and ask for assistance.Oakley Contact InformationAlternatively, it may be an idea to contact Oakley direct and either ask for assistance or a replacement manual if the original manual was lost in some way.

Basically, a true Breitling watch of this make and model will come with all manner of documentation and packaging that proves it authenticity. These types of wristwatches, when genuine, are quite expensive; you won't find one for sale on the street, unless it is stolen. 99 percent of the time, you can be certain any watch you buy without paperwork or other supporting provenance will be a clever replica of an original. Of course, you can always take your watch to a certified appraisal expert or jewelry to make sure - but beware! If your watch is a fake, the jeweler or appraiser may be obligated to report you to the manufacturer.The serial number alone is not enough to prove the authenticity of your watch, since it can be faked so easily. To get a better sense of whether or not your watch is the real things, look at it closely and check for a distinctive, luminous blue-purple glow on the crystal. A true Breitling will always have this characteristic, and a fake won't; the markers on your wristwatch should also have a luminous quality. The logo on your watch should be expertly engraved, and not painted onto the surface. The watch itself should have a solid, weighty feel, since it is made with precious metals and the finest materials. Fakes will not have the same substance and weight, and their details will not be as finely crafted.Replicas of famous watches, such as Breitling Bentley's, are available all over the world. Many people are content to wear copies of the original, since they can't afford the real things, or they don't wish to invest that much disposable income in a timepiece. However, true Breitling watches will usually be accompanied by proper documentation that confirms they are genuine. Without this paperwork, it's pretty safe to say you're wearing a facsimile.\",\n",

       " 'Is A Breitling Bentley Watch Serial Number A25362 Real?': [\"Breitling is a brand of Swiss watches produced by Breitling SA, a private company headquartered in Grenchen, Canton of Solothurn, originally founded in Saint-Imier, Bernese Jura by Léon Breitling in 1884.The watchmaker offers high-end Certified Chronometers designed primarily for aviation use. Breitling's watches offer aviation functions, though their chronograph functions have become more of status symbols than practically applied tools. They typically have a large face e.g. The Breitling for Bentley Motors edition has a 48 mm Case Diameter for better visibility and to allow display of more information on the analog dials. Many models feature an automatic winding mechanism that is purely mechanical i.e. Using no electronic components. Many Breitling watches are equipped with additional functions such as the flyback function, split-second, moon phase, date display and other applications.All Breitling watches are manufactured in Switzerland and are made from Swiss components. Raw materials are obtained from ETA and Valjoux and are modified in the Breitling Chronometrie Workshops, before undergoing COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres) certification. As of 2009, Breitling now makes manufacture movements, designs, manufacture and assemble the Breitling watches completely in-house.Quartz models such as the Breitling Aeromarine Colt start at $2,055.00 on a rubber strap, while typical prices of mechanical, steel cased models are $7,300 (US) for the Breitling for Bentley Motors model. The expense is due to the exclusivity of the Bentley trademark, as well as the 38 jewel self-winding movement as these steel cased models are more expensive than some of Breitling's Titanium or Gold models. Some special edition models also include diamonds on various parts of the watch. I.E. Diamond Bezel, Diamond Bracelet, etc.Breitling was a sponsor of Team Bentley during their Le Mans 24 Hours campaign, running from 2001-2003. To commemorate this event, Breitling created the Limited Edition Breitling Bentley 24 Le Mans Watch. The serial number A25362 is a real serial number for a Breitling for Bentley Motors watch, though it is well advised to make sure that is the serial number on your watch, and if buying one of the watches it wise to thoroughly check it out before hand as there are many fakes produced.\",\n",

They wore pearl pendant on golden chains and velvet dresses, held out by many layers of petticoats and hoops. Corsets were always worn, for a woman's waist must be no larger than 25-27 inches. Their knickers were knee-length and baggy. Stockings were attached to the knickers. They were often made of wool.Men wore breeches, which were like puffy shorts, and stockings. They wore plain shirts but elaborate waistcoats made of velvet or some kind of soft cloth. Fur caps were worn and brown or black leather shoes. Gold medallions were always worn around necks and rings were placed on almost every finger.\",\n",

       "  'The rich would often wear black. This is because the material would have to be dyed several times to attain the degree of colour required. After dying, the material would have to be dried. Then a Tailor or seamstress would need to cut the material to your needs. All of the above took time, and a great deal of money. Bohemians, such as Shakespeare, Drake and Raleigh would often have jewellery sewn into their outer garments to emphasise their \"individuality\", especially in the latter two, Shakespeare was a little more reserved and is seen to only sport an earring in the only \"portrait\" of him yet discovered, the Chandos portrait.',\n",

The thing to remember is that everyone, even slim women, can be unhappy with at least one part of their body; someone might be proud of their toned stomach but a bit self-conscious about their ‘big bum’.If you want a dress that can make you appear slimmer, opt for darker colours like black, navy blue and maroon etc. Which can cleverly disguise unflattering areas. However, if there are parts of your body that you particularly like, emphasize these by adding a dash of colour or patterns to attract attention and to divert from other ‘problem’ areas at the same time.Always emphasize your waist by opting for a dress that nips in at the waist - a waist belt is also a good idea. By accentuating your midriff area, this will help to create an illusion of an hourglass figure that you didn’t know you had! Dresses can be flared out after the waist area to cover excess fat around the hips and bum.Don’t be tempted to hide yourself under layers of baggy fabric as this can actually make you look frumpy and appear bigger. Find something that is well-fitted but not necessarily tight and uncomfortable to move in. Even though you may be confident about your body, try to avoid mini-length dresses that fall on the thigh. Instead, go for lengths that end mid-knee as this is the part where your leg is slimmer.Other things to consider are prints, seams, stripes and v-necks. Swap large prints for smaller ones to make you look more delicate, go for vertical stripes instead of horizontal stripes to balance your body shape out and don’t be scared to try v-neck or plunging neckline dresses to complement your curvaceous assets!',\n",

Velvet and rich materials were sewn into costumes very ornate. Rich people tried to emulate the Nobles in fashion. Men wore wide short breeches, with hose, shirts were finely decorated and of course they wore hats with feathers. Women wore smaller hats, ornately beaded and bejewelled. Shoes or slippers were of 2 kinds , soft and somewhat pointed, or hard with clasps and ornamentation. Boots were favored by men. Women wore several layers of clothes to achieve the final effect that we see in the art from that period. Necklines and sleeve cuffs were focal points for fancy details. The wearing of jewelry was a huge status symbol and quite fashionable, with real jewels and pearls often sewn into the costumes at large.'],\n",

This added protection allow humans to move into environments that otherwise would be uncomfortable or dangerous (hot sand, sharp rocks, woods with thorns, etc etc). Humans were thus better able to survive and prosper. As footwear developed, there have been advances in crafting shoes to overcome weaknesses in some peoples feet (fallen arches, excess pronation, inadequate padding on the soles, and other problems). In addition, specialized shoes now allow us to perform sports longer and with less stress to the feet, knees and back. Other examples of specialized footware include steel-toed boots/shoes that have saved workers from toe or foot amputations from accidents. A person could write a book on the benefits of shoes, (and they probably already have), so I'd better stop here.\",\n",
       "  \"As per the above answer, shoes help protect our feet.Properly fitted shoes also ensure that your feet can grow safely, without increased risk of foot development disorders.Poorly fitted shoes can have a negative impact on the health of your feet, particularly in the long-term.Therefore, shoes can only help the health of our feet if they are correctly fitted.It is for this reason why children in particular should always have their feet properly measured. Kids shoes should be fitted taking into account both the length and width of each foot, because the bones in their feet are not fully formed until they reach the age of 18.Failure to take into account both the length and width can therefore lead to mis-shapen feet, leading to all sorts of health risks in your child's feet, as well as all manner of spine and hip problems.More information on shoe measuring and the importance of fitted shoes for children can be found here:http://www.startriteshoes.com/fitting/what-is-fitted-footwearMore detailed information on Podiatry (foot health in general) can be found here:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_health\",\n",

       "  'There are many benefits of shoes:Physical Benefits of ShoesIn the early 1900s, there was an epidemic of hookworms in Mississippi and other rural American states. Improper sanitary facilities in combination with the lack of foot protection lead to the parasitic worm being able to bore itself into a foot in a corkscrew-like manner. Severe illness would ensue after a hookworm infection with anemia being the biggest health concern. However, an educational health campaign reinforcing the importance of wearing shoes and sanitary public facilities helped make hookworms virtually unheard of in the affected areas.While the hookworm epidemic is no longer a concern in the U.S., today the need for proper footwear is still critical as a way of reducing the risk of certain parasitic diseases and foot infections in third world countries.Diabetics can also be susceptible to foot infections in the form of ulcers and can lead to amputation. It is important to have proper footwear to minimize diabetic foot infections and to provide support to feet for comfort and proper healing. Other foot conditions, like bunions, Charcot foot, and corns can also be alleviated with proper foot wear.Shoes not only help our feet to heal but can also aid in support and stability of our foot. Not all feet are perfect, so properly fitting shoes can help align your feet, ankles, knees, hips and back to correct your gait and improve posture.Without supportive shoes, the biomechanics of the body are off causing unnecessary impact and stress on parts of your feet and knees that aren’t meant for shock absorption or pressure. This can eventually lead to back, knee and foot pain.It is important to note that poorly fitted shoes can have a negative impact on your foot health. Accounting for the foot length and width can help prevent any foot development disorders. Keep in mind that growth spurts in children are rapid so a proper foot measurements on a regular basis is important. Replacement of shoes that no longer serve your feet as intended is necessary to maintain optimal foot conditions and protection for your feet.The Cultural Importance of ShoesThe types of shoes worn differs from culture to culture, however, in most cultures, shoes are representative of social status or an extension of one’s self. Shoes can affect our perception of others as well as ourselves.Certain shoes can be seen as an item of decoration for fashion and can have less to do with functionality. In the Western World, high heels or stilettos can be expressive of a women’s adulthood and sexuality. The shoes offer a sleek design while elongating their legs and changing their stance as a means for look and attraction.However, not every culture uses shoes for fashion or a sign of wealth. There are many reasons for the use of shoes.In South Africa, during the apartheid era, miners were not allowed to verbally talk underneath the surface in mine tunnels. For this matter, they developed a form of communication – also known as the “Gumboot Dance”- through foot taps and stamps, similar to Morse Code. The miners were forced to use Gumboots or Wellington boots as a means to obtain foot health while the miners were in the knee-high infected waters for hours daily. The Gumboots have become a cultural symbol for resistance for the South African miners.Footwear is also used as a for ceremonies or religious devotions in various cultures. As part of the Indian culture, shoes are lavishly designed with embroidery, inlaid with precious stones and metals, and adorned with bells and tassels. The Indian culture praises the feet, so in ceremonious occasions, feet are clothed in beautiful garments for celebration and honor.However, there are a wide range of cultural views of feet, while in America the idea of walking barefoot outside can symbolize freedom and attaching to one’s youthfulness, people in Japan perceive feet as a body part that must remain clean, so wearing shoes outdoors in necessary in their society.The Psychological Importance of ShoesIn the 1994 movie, The Sandlot, an autographed baseball signed by Babe Ruth is knocked into a neighboring backyard that is home to a perceived vicious dog. From there, a group of young boys develop intricate plans to stealthily obtain the highly-valued baseball. All of their attempts failed, except for one that included one of the boys who hopped the fence wearing a brand new pair of P.F. Flyers that were perceived by the group to make you run faster and jump higher.Through the P.F. Flyers, the boy’s confidence to take the feat head on increased because of his perception of the superhuman-like abilities wearing the shoes provided him. This type of perception is quite common and can not only boost the performance of a skill but can also provide benefits to the personality development of adolescents.There is this perceived magical transformation to turn someone from ordinary to a superstar or model.Similarly, an aspiring athlete may obtain a new pair of basketball shoes worn by their idol in an attempt to jump high or improve their jump shot, while a dancer’s first Pointe shoes may symbolize an effort to explore more deeply the art of expression through ballet.Through perception, shoes hold value that is unique to the wearer and their environment. For example, an expensive cowboy boot with quality leather and a rugged look can invoke a perception that the wearer has a strong personality type that is independent, callused, and alienated from civilization.While shoes have a basic functional purpose with many benefits, there are also beliefs and intrinsic values that accompany them. While the lack of shoes cannot strip one of individuality nor can the lack of shoes keep a person from traveling, life is a lot easier when shoes are present. Shoes allow us to travel farther, be more expressive, improve our performance and aid in overall health. From our soles to our souls, shoes contribute a great deal to our human experience.While shoes have a basic functional purpose with many benefits, there are also beliefs and intrinsic values that accompany them.

One of the chief benefits of school uniforms, say proponents, is that they make schools safer. Uniforms are said to reduce gang influence, minimize violence by reducing some sources of conflict, and help to identify trespassers. Parents benefit because they are no longer pressured to buy the latest fashions, and they spend less on their children\\'s clothing. Having a uniform stops gang members from displaying their colours and garb. The schools also believe it helps stop violence and helps instill a sense of pride in the students. It also helps to break down the barriers between different socioeconomic groups. I feel we should keep to the uniform. It sets an example of the school. It is representation the community. It is easy to point out different people. Also there would be more fights/bully due to the lack of \\'fashion\\'. \"',\n",

You should presume that an online purchase, unless it was from an official vendor or reputable store, is fake. The Breitling fan site claims that 99 per cent of all Breitlings online are fakes. You are advised to check the model number against real model numbers and real model pictures to prove its authenticity.There are other ways of picking between real and fake. Weight is one method. A genuine Breitling has a hefty feel to it and is considered heavier than other watches. The cheaper components in a fake make it lighter.In general, a cheap feel may be present in fakes. The logo is a good place to look for a fault. On a genuine watch the logo is perfectly straight and embossed onto the face. A counterfeit, due to poor production technique, is more likely to simply be printed onto the face.On all Breitling watches is a date window. On genuine models this is a magnifying section and enlarges the whole date and part of the second and minute hands. On copies the date window magnifying section is smaller, and the glass is weaker strength in its magnification.Models also feature a chronograph. This is a sub-dial. This is generally the only sub-dial. Models do not feature the days of the week or months instead of this, rather in certain models they feature both, but generally just the chronograph.Another check method is the movement of the second hand. Counterfeits use a quartz movement, giving the hand a tick wobble. The genuine product sweeps smoothly. This is not the case for 70s and early 80s Breitling models, which did switch to the quartz movement but then reverted.Other subtleties include the anti-glare coating that models feature. If it doesn't give a bluish purple hue of a reflection then it's probably counterfeit. Spelling mistakes are another giveaway, and while they are harder to check in Swiss or French it really is worth the investigation.\",\n",

Thanks, Joy': [\"A quick online search gives evidence to suggest that SneakerNice.com is a scam site. Customers have complained that products they ordered from the online store has arrived and turned out to be fakes. Shoes have arrived in the incorrect sizes and made from synthetic cheap material. When consumers have tried to contact the customer service line about the products it is a task that is nearly impossible. In order to get a refund on the product, customers are required to pay for delivery of the shoes back to China, something that is likely to cost more than the value of the shoes themselves. Some customers have stated that the shoes are very 'good fakes' but they are definitely not the genuine thing.Usually if the prices on an online store looks too good to be true, they are. Comparing the prices on websites, such as SneakerNice.com, to other online shoe stores should give you an idea about how realistic the offers are. Keep an eye out for any indications that payments on the website are secure. Some customers of SneakerNice.com have stated that there are no security measures in place for making online payments. This can lead to problems should your bank account details be put at risk by the website.Typically official sellers of Nike shoes will have some sort of logo or badge that states they are eligible to sell the real thing. Links back to the Nike site and realistic prices are key clues to look out for. If you have any doubt that the website you are browsing is not genuine, an online search of the store's name followed by keywords such as 'spam' or 'legit', should guide you to online forums where customers may have discussed any problems they have had. These scam sites can be reported to the official shoe brands, such as Nike, to make them aware of their existence.\",\n",

However, I asked my friends their sizes, a group of 10. Roughly, the average came to a size 10/12. We all have really different builds though which is why there is a slash there. I would trust the 12 more than the 10 though, don't ask why.. Lmao.\",\n",

However, studies proved that men in ancient tribes found in Asia and Arica were the first to use them. Wearing a thong is like wearing nothing at all since it covers very little parts of the genital areas and buttocks. Many find it uncomfortable due to it thin material and minimal coverage but there are many who also find it very convenient to use.A thong can be an underwear or a swimsuit. In front it looks like a bikini but at the back, a thin waistband and strip of material can be found used to cover the perineum and anus. Literally the thong covers areas which mustn’t be left visible to the public eye such as the genitals, pubic hair, and anus.Thongs vary in design, depending on the purpose. Those which are worn as underwear can be made of lace or cotton while those worn as a bikini are usually made of spandex and lycra.Over the years, thongs evolved from a mere undergarment to something very fashionable. Today, you’ll be surprised to find women wearing low rise jeans and shorts over their thong with the waist band visible. It’s a very provocative and seductive fashion statement which many teenagers and women below thirties are adapting today. Of course, thongs like T-back bikinis remain very popular at the beach with women wearing them in broad daylight when they’re sunbathing, playing beach volleyball or swimming.You can buy thongs in leading department stores and even online. They are affordable and made of different materials. Designer thongs are of course more expensive but you can find one that’s of good quality at a cheaper price.However, conservative members of the society are against thongs. They don’t cover much at all. In addition, there are those who wear them before that complain about experiencing pain when wearing a thong and even afterwards when they already switched to more comfortable undergarments.',\n",

It does seem that six inches is plenty of width, especially being useful for cross-dressers and men with a fetish for panties.Others which are recommended include Body Caress and Hipsters. In the 1940s, new styles of women's undergarments became available in the West that possessed a greater sense of sexuality focused on comfort and individuality, versus functionality and conformance to a certain body type. Colorful, bright, and flashier fashions of women's lingerie were becoming available.More fabrics began to be incorporated into the makeup of women's lingerie, making them more desired by females and more sensual to males. This is when panties became more than simple hygiene products and developed into an icon of pleasure and sexuality worldwide.

Fake beauty enhancements are not scored highly especially over natural beauty.Many girls DO gain a lot of confidence from contests, as well as developing social skills and potential contacts if they are chosing a career in modelling, presenting or media etc. Others you will find come from a vast background of careers including soldiers, nurses and lawyers.

Now something to massage your tired feet. How about some petroleum jelly?

If you have a warranty on your sunglasses and it covers accidental breakage or loss, you should check whether or not the expiry date has passed yet. If your sun shades are still in warranty, you may be entitled to a complimentary arm replacement. If the arms on your sunglasses aren't actually broken and you simply want to exchange them for personal or style reasons, however, this will not be covered under your warranty and you'll need to pay the full amount for a replacement set.To find sunglass accessories including new frames and arms for your Oakley sun shades, visitwww.oakley.com/store/products. Here, you'll find a range of authentic Oakley products to suit male and female sunglass designs. If you can't find the arms to suit your model or the range you bought your sunglasses from has been discontinued, get in touch with the Oakley Customer Service Team via email or phone, as they may be able to produce a one-off set of replacement arms for your model at a small extra cost.If you still can't find the replacement arms you need for your Oakley glasses, consider looking on an online marketplace such as eBay or Amazon. Both of these popular sites host sellers who stock a broad array of discontinued goods from designer ranges. Be sure to check that the product you buy is 100% authentic, though, as you may not be entitled to a refund once you have a bid accepted.In the worst case scenario, if you can't find a legitimate pair of Oakley sunglass replacement arms after trying all the options out there, you'll need to invest in either a new pair of glasses or an unbranded pair of arms to fit onto your shades.

These quirky products were designed to encourage children to pretend to be the superhero or character and so very closely resembled the actual outfit, especially in the case of Wonder Woman and Superman.You can buy similar products from most large department stores and quite often high street clothing stores e.g. Topman, Primark etc. Will also stock a small supply of superhero underwear. In addition to this, some joke, fancy dress shops sell actual superhero pyjamas.The original Underoos came in many different designs including A Team, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Barbie, Aquagirl, Batgirl, Batman, Captain America, Gummybears, Gremalins, The Joker, Pacman, Princess Leia, Ghostbusters, Scooby Doo, Spiderman, Tarzan, Wonderwoman, Thundercats and Yoda to name just a few. The adult’s ones which are sold now are most likely to be the very popular characters such as Batman. You can still find original childrens versions online however, an original unopened set of original Underoos could cost you as much as $70.',\n",

These will play an important part of the dying process.\\xa0 They are cheap and easy to find just about anywhere.Soak the pumice stones in chlorine bleach.Load the jeans and the stones into an industrial washer. Or as I have done... Do it in a bathtub, but turn the fan on, open a window and cover your mouth and nose, because the fumes are icky.Check on the jeans after 15 minutes. The typical time it takes is 25 minutes, but you want to check to make sure. You don't want to go too far in either direction with acid washing. Too little can make a fabric look awful, and over-doing it can destroy a great pair of jeans.Keep checking every ten minutes after that for just the right look!Once the jeans are dyed to perfection, they should be transferred to another machine (or if you did it in the bath tub, just transfer it to your regular washer), and have rock salt added to water they are washed with. Leave them washing for five minutes in this process. This will remove any remaining chlorine. (It may small like rotten eggs, no worries.)Wash jeans in water for five minutes more to remove any grit from the stones and any possible remaining chlorine.Put the jeans in a high-powered drier until all dry! You now have completed the process of acid washing.\",\n",
       "  'Acid wash is a method of making a fabric different from normal jeans. The following is the method for the acid washing process.Get spongy pumice stones. Dip them in chlorine. Get 2 washing machines. Put the jeans and the stones into washer. Watch the jeans after 15 minutes. Normally it will take 25 minutes. Too little can make a fabric look terrible, and over-doing it can tear down the jeans. Therefore, keep on checking after every 10 minutes. Once the jeans are dyed, they are placed in another machine, and the antichlor (sodium bisulfate) added and then the jeans are washed with again. Wash it for 5 minutes and then wash it with water for five minutes in order to remove stones and any remaining chlorine. Dry the jeans with the help of washing machine direrAnother other way: Is spray the beach in patches on a pair of jeans and then leave it for 5 minutes. After this wash it. This will give a unique look but not the same look as the one given by the washer.'],\n",

According to estimates by the Swiss Customs Service, there are some 30 to 40 million counterfeit watches put into circulation each year. For example, the number and value of Customs' seizures rose from CHF 400,000 and 18 seizures in 1995 to CHF 10,300,000 and 572 seizures in 2005.\\xa0 Counterfeit watches cause an estimated $1 billion loss per year to the watch industry.Forgery of watches became a serious problem in the eighteenth century when Britain came to rival France as the leading producer of quality clocks and watches. By the middle of the century, watchmakers in Augsburg, Germany and in various small towns in French-speaking Switzerland were producing watches falsely signed with the names of well-known English makers such as George Graham and Eardley Norton. Other, less obvious, forgeries carried imaginary names with a vaguely English sound, such as 'Samson' or 'Simpton'.In the following century Breguet became a frequent target for forgers; at the same time British makers continued to suffer, many forgeries bearing the name 'M. J. Tobias' - a mistake for a real London maker named Michael Isaac Tobias. In the 1860s, when the American watch industry was gaining strength, the Swiss industry was responsible for many imitations of Waltham watches. These, unlike most of the earlier forgeries, often imitated the appearance of the genuine article quite closely as well as borrowing the names. This practice died out in the early 1870s, as the Swiss could not compete, so surrendered the mass-market field to U.S. Firms and focused on branding high end status symbols.However if you do wish to buy a replica/counterfeit watch then one of the website listed below may be of use as they all have a range of counterfeit watches available.Www.1tictoc.comwww.watch-inc.comwww.abwatch.comwww.e-watchshop.com\",\n",

Some people like to have a pair of sunglasses with a designer label that is flashy and obvious while other people prefer and understated designer.Some people do not care about the designer, so long as they are sturdy, practical and shield their eyes. Some people prefer them to be huge to cover the whole eye area, whereas others prefer smaller glasses that do not take over the whole face. Some people will simply choose the cheapest pair of sunglasses they can find because they are the kind of delicate object that are easily lost or broken.Whatever style or design or sunglasses you opt for, there are some points you should consider. The first is how much protection the glasses offer from ultraviolet light. Sunglasses are usually thought of as a stylish fashion accessory but there is much more to them and they can actually have a huge effect on your vision if you choose the right pair.UV rays are particularly hazardous to our eyesight; they cause cataracts, macular degeneration and host of other ailments including skin cancer. If you buy a pair of sunglasses which protect against UV rays, it could really benefit your eyesight in the future.Polarized lenses are now much more widely available and provide crisper vision, particularly when it is extremely bright or sunny. Contrary to what you might think, light doesn’t travel in a straight line, it bounces back and forth from one reflective surface to another. This causes glare, especially from glass, water, shiny green grass and even white sand from such things as sand traps and beaches. Polarized lenses permit only vertical light rays to pass through them, not horizontal, and thus they reduce glare.Think about durability when you choose the style and get a friend to help you decide which suit the shape of your face the best. When choosing the colour of the lenses, be aware that different coloured lenses make everything around you look different. Grey lenses tend to be the most neutral but brown lenses can make everything appear warmer.',\n",

If your dress is truly beautiful and detailed and you wish to show it off, then it may be the better option to go for matching shoes. If you go for a bold colour instead then the attention may be distracted from your dress’ intricate detail.Something that will make you stand out and look really great is to choose a deep and rich block colour such as a deep red or purple. If you choose a court shoe or a similar style, select nothing too fancy. If you buy a deep red shoe with matching accessories, this will really make your outfit pop. People’s eyes will be drawn to your deep colours.If you are feeling particularly brave and daring, a bright green or neon pink with matching accessories (of course) will do the same as a red or purple but it will look even more amazing!Although you could choose to go for a more intricate or strappy shoe design but if you do a bronze or a warm gold colour.

       " \"How To Tie A Clip On Tie That's Become Undone?\": [\"Under normal circumstances, the obvious first question would be why you would bother learning to tie a clip-on tie?.If the clip-on is being used for safety reasons, then the question becomes one of construction quality - some clip-ons are essentially ordinary ties, glued into place and then clipped. Others are made of 'scraps' of material that, if they become undone, are not able to be re-tied.In either case, if it is remotely financially viable, the easiest option would seem to be to buy a new clip-on. Clip-on bow-ties are usually made on the scrap principle, and are therefore, to all intents and purposes, not able to be re-tied.Step-by-step guidelinesHowever, assuming that a) this course of action is not financially viable and b) the tie is a regular necktie, able to be re-tied, try this procedure:· Position the tie so it looks as though it's being worn by someone else.· Position the part of the tie that looks like an inverted triangle up against the front part of the clip.· Bring the narrow part of the tie around the back of the clip.· Loop the narrow part back over the front of the clip and tuck it under the front part of the tie.· Repeat the procedure with the front (wider) part of the tie (making sure the wide part of the tie is in front of the narrow part).· Adjust for style.· Fasten tie to the back spot (where the clip is) with glue, pins or even with stitches.This is a fiddly procedure at practically every point, which again suggests the benefits of buying a new clip-on if at all possible.\",\n",

       " 'Kit Gloves Or Kid Gloves?': [\"These two terms are often mixed up because of the slight difference in their spelling.The term 'kid gloves' is an expression which means that something is being handled, or will need to be handled, carefully. The phrase comes from the early 1800s where a physical glove was made from young lamb or goat's skin and had a very fine soft touch to them as opposed to other gloves that were made from strong leathers. It became a symbol of soft elegance and then the term 'handle with kid gloves' derived from it, meaning that you need to be very gentle in a certain situation. In the 1800s it was also a term that was used to describe an individual as dainty and upper class, who never partook in manual work. The phrase 'the gloves are coming off' derived from this initial saying which means that someone is acting in a harsh and blunt way towards another person.While the term 'kid gloves' is used as an expression, the term 'kit gloves' refers to physical gloves. They are used when carrying out repair work and are offered supplied within kits that include other tools to help repair any physical damages. They are often made with fine cloth which aims to keep human oil of the parts that need to be repaired. Others are sometimes made of latex or vinyl which allows the hands to work intricately but prevents contact from any human oils that may contaminate the substances you are working on.\",\n",
       "  'Kid gloves actually refers to what the gloves themselves were made out of. They were made out of kid skin; which is the skin of a young goat or lamb. These gloves were softer and finer than ones made out of harder leathers from adult animals and thus became a symbol of gentility and refinement. To \"wear kid gloves\" means the person is genteel or dainty and above the menial work of the lower class. Likewise, to \"handle a person with kid gloves\" is to treat them gentle like they are fragile or upper class.',\n",

What About With A Pin?(Cameo?)': ['Wearing a scarf with a dress looks very ladylike and elegant and can provide the perfect finish to an outfit that looked like it was missing something. Don’t think of those huge woolly scarves that you use in the winter to keep out the bitter winds. Think delicate scarves in light colours that drape around your neck, immediately drawing the eyes of everyone in the room onto you.When picking the right scarf to go with your dress, then the colour is extremely important. You wouldn’t wear a green scarf with a purple dress now would you? Also, don’t pick a scarf that is the exact same shade as your dress. Although block colours are indeed the hot trend this season, it doesn’t mean that you can’t add a bit of variation. It makes you look interesting. By all means pick a scarf the same basic colour, but go a shade lighter so it looks as if the colour fades as eyes travel up your body. For example, if your dress is a dark violet, then choose a slightly light purple scarf without going as light as lilac.The style of the dress is also extremely important. The best style to wear a scarf with is strapless, as a see-through scarf will still show that you are womanly by showing off your shoulders and chest, but that you are still a lady by remaining modest. No gentleman likes a lady who flashes their most intimate places. Scarves can be worn with strappy dress, although this can sometimes lead to your shoulder and neck area being too crowded, especially if you are wearing a necklace and long earrings. Simplicity is the key by showing that you can be beautiful, graceful and elegant with as little as possible.Also, do not wrap the scarf tightly around your neck like a Boa Constrictor. Drape it lightly across your shoulders along the two either ends to drape over your arms, wearing it as a shawl. This is a classic style that never goes out of fashion.',\n",

Leave about one inch of excess material up into the inside of the leg. Trim the excess off. Pressing with a hot iron will insure a equal hemline.

The ripple sole is characterised by its lines of triangular jagged rubber, or whatever that particular sole is made of, running horizontally along the sole of the shoe. Ripple soles are good for gripping on slippery surfaces and are very durable. They are often used by the army or on sturdy work boots because they provide superior grip on surfaces.They are often used in the jungle or muddy places as well because the design of the sole means that it is very difficult for mud to get lodged in the dents of the sole. This means that ripple sole shoes should maintain grip where other soles won’t. They last a very long time due to the thickness of the rubber required to make them. They are very chunky to aid balance and wide to aid grip as much as possible.If you are looking to buy some ripple soles, there are many outlets on the internet, including endclothing.co.uk and if you are looking for some that are cheaper, there are quite a few pairs on eBay in varying designs, sizes and colours, including black, beige and tan. You are most likely to find ripple soles on boots and shoes because they are too chunky for slighter footwear.The ripple sole was invented by Nathan Hack in 1955. Investors in the sole include Reebok and Columbia trading company, both huge players in the shoe and boot retail industry. If you type \"ripple sole” in to Google you can see pictures of ripple soled shoes. They are quite hard to describe without looking at a picture of them.',\n",

       " 'How Do I Tell If My Rolex Is Fake?': ['One of the easiest ways to identify a fake Rolex watch is by the case back. Counterfeiters use a clear display, or \"skeleton\" case back, allowing you\\xa0to view the inner workings of the watch. Next way to identify fake Rolex watches is the engraved case backs. Again, Rolex watch does not have any engraving like at the case back with logos, hallmarks, or designs. Rare exceptions are ladies\\' models (prior to the mid 1990\\'s) which had \"Original Rolex Design\" or a similar disparity thereof, engraved on the case back in an arc way. Also on the Sea-Dweller case backs has \"ROLEX\\xa0OYSTER ORIGINAL GAS\\xa0ESCAPE\\xa0VALVE\" etched around the outside of the case back in an arc fashion.Real Rolex models are sent fresh from the factory with a Hologram-encoded (3-dimensional) sticker on the case back. This sticker features the trademarked Rolex \"crown\" placed above the watch\\'s case reference number.The hologram can be easily recognized by viewing it from different angles, therefore causing the background pattern to change. In fact, imitation stickers are not holograms at all, but rather repetitious\"Rolex\"pattern which does not vary in appearance when viewed from different angles. And the real Rolex hologram stickers did not mark the \"crown logo\" as part of the hologram until 2002, when the sticker was spruced up. At the same year also, the Reference number was also altered from gold lettering to black, up until now. For real Rolexes, the crystal (on all latest date models--except the Sea-Dweller) will have a glass bubble, or \"Cyclops\" fixed to the crystal, positioned above the date: For the purpose of magnifying the tiny aperture and also at 2.5 times magnification.On fake models the date magnification is more like 1.5 times. The date window should virtually \"fill up\" the Cyclops--the counterfeits don\\'t even come close. Fakes are now marking a new larger font date wheel to give the effect of being magnified at a full 2.5 times.Rolex model mark the Triplock crown (i.e. Sea-Dweller,Submariner, and Daytona) employ an extra seal contained by the threads of the winding crown\\'s tube. This gasket appears like a black o-ring and can be visible when the winding crown is unscrewed fully. Fake models will not include this o-ring seal, but rather will have basic screw-down threads. Some new counterfeits will feature a \"similar\" looking rubber seal, yet upon examining closely, you will see that it is purely ornamental, and is not functional.With the 3 tiny dots positioned under the trademarked “crown logo of the Rolex, the Triplock crown can be identified by which is engraved on the end on the winding crown.The thickness of the minute hand in the GenuineRolex Yacht-Mastermodels compared toRolex sports models. Imitators most often than not use the same hands set up on theSubmariner. And frequently use hands which are of the wrong size and/or shape. In the genuine Daytona features a \"minute\" hand which reaches up to the outer \"hash\" marks. The hands on the fake models are much shorter and the \"shape\" of the hands is incorrect. Current Daytona models feature hands which are \"rounded\" on the tips.Rolex Daytona genuine models include mini-registers on the dial which execute Chronograph \"stop watch\" functions (i.e. Elapsed hours and minutes). In the fake Rolex watch, the large \"sweep\" hand on the dial is also part of the stop watch function, and acts as non primary second hand-- the second hand is the small 20/40/60 register. However, fake models atypically perform these functions, but somewhat used for \"24-hour time\", \"day of week\", and \"date\". Moreover, on counterfeits, the size and position will often be incorrect of these mini registers.Brand new for 2002, Rolex watch has started micro-etching a tiny \"coronet\" (or crown) logo into the crystal, at the 6 o\\'clock position. And probably the most precise way to identify a genuine/counterfeit Rolex watch is by locating the Serial and Case Reference Numbers. These unique identification numbers are etched on the side of the case, located between the lugs.',\n",

But first of all let me just say don't get lost in the answer and forget about your own creativity......1.) You can put the scarf around the back of your neck so the ends of the scarf are uneven and tie it once and then again so you have a knot that is snug to your neck. Pull the knot gently to the right or the left so that it is not hanging straight down from the centre of your neck. This allows the scarf to hang beautifully and it will compliment just about any outfit nicely.2.) If you're wearing a blazer you can put it underneath the collar and just let it hang.3.) Tie the scarf around your neck as described in number 1 but loosen it a bit. Then place a blazer or button up shirt over it and gently fluff the scarf. This gives a sophisticated look. This is also done with winter scarves under the heavy jacket.4.) If you don't mind bows, you could tie a simple bow and also put the bow off to the right or the left of the neck.5.) You could use the scarf to hold back your hair by placing the scarf around your neck and then pull both ends up and tie on top of your head. You could choose a knot or a bow or even pull the knot so it's at the base of your neck while the rest of the scarf flows nicely behind your hair.6.) If the scarf is long enough you could also use it as a belt tying loosely and letting the excess hang either to the left or the right of your waist. (Tie 2 or more matching scarves together if you need to - to get the desired look and effect.)I hope this helps you.\",\n",
       "  \"I thought of something else. Add this to #6. You could also incorporate beads into you belt by wrapping them around it and tying gently. The beads will give it a different look altogether.7.) Take the scarf and hold one corner with one hand and grab the opposite corner with the other hand and either roll or twirl the scarf until you have one column. You can tie this around your neck alone or also twist in some beads or another fabric. This will give the look of a necklace or even a unique choker.Stand in front of a mirror and try these ideas out and see what you think. Also incorporate things you have like pins or beads to create your own look. Don't forget to think outside the box and try something you wouldn't normally think of wearing.

Even fat women can look slim if they know the tricks of fashion.Following are the tips that will make women look gorgeous, elegant and stunning!1. Pick one hue. Dressing head-to-toe in a single dark colour, like navy or black is the single best way to look like a person who has lost a lot of weight.2. Skip large pattern. Smaller patterns fool the eyes and make for a more delicate look. One should not wear patterns on top and bottom since it tends to add more weight.3. You should slip on the right length skirt and stick to just-above-the-knee skirts that play off knees and elongate legs. You should avoid a mid calf skirt which draws attention to the widest part of the legs, making them look heavier.4. Capri pants are surprisingly slimming, especially if you stick to dark denim or black and wear those aren't too short or too long. They should end at the least-wide part of your calves, ideally a few inches of your ankle.5. Wear a sexy T-shirt V-neck and deep scoop nect T-shirts elongate the neck and make the torso appear longer by showing off your collarbone.6. You can wear clothes which have thin vertical stripes on anything. They can be the pants, shirts, skirts or dresses. They creat the illusion of a longer leaner body.7. Slim down with colour. Hot summer hues like pink and yellow catch the eye and are good for body parts you want to play up. Pair them with black, brown or navy - dark colours recede and are best for areas that you'd like to draw the eye away from.\",\n",

These two visionary immigrants, turned denim, thread and a little metal into the most popular clothing product in the world. Waist overalls, was the traditional name for work pants, which is what these first jeans were called. The word jeans became more popular around 1960 when the baby-boom generation adopted the term for its favorite type of pants, blue jeans..He word \"jeans\" comes from the French phrase bleu de Gênes, literally the blue of Genoa. Jeans fabric, or denim, originated independently in two places: The French town of Nîmes, to which \\'denim\\' owes its name; and in India, where trousers made of denim material were worn by the sailors of Dhunga, which came to be known as dungarees.[2]At the same time, denim trousers were made in Chieri, a town near Turin (Italy), during the Renaissance, and were popularised in the 19th century. These trousers were sold through the harbour of Genoa, which was the capital of the independent Republic of Genoa which was a naval power.Early examples of trousers were made for the Genoese Navy, which required all-purpose pants for its sailors. They required pants that could be wet or dry, the legs of which could be worn while swabbing the deck. These were laundered by dragging them in nets behind the ship, and the sea water and sun would gradually bleach them to white. They were worn by Genoan sailors and stevedores in France.The typical American blue jeans, as well know them, were first invented by Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss, as far back as the year 1873! These two gifted immigrants had the foresight to see what could be made out of a simple piece of denim, thread, and a piece of metal. When they made the world\\'s first pair of blue jeans, however, they meant it to be used for working in. Therefore, they called them \\'waist overalls\\'. Meant to be used by workers, it was supposed to be a sturdy and at the same time practical and comfortable dress. Initially, the waist overalls were made in indigo blue and \\'duck\\' brown, but the popularity of the blue pants far exceeded that of the brown pants, and soon, everyone everywhere wanted to own and to wear a pair of blue jeans, a term invented by the \\'baby boom\\' generation, which craved blue jeans.

As well as show length, shoe width must be considered, and this can vary between shoe stores.Whether you are buying clothes, shoes or accessories, it is crucial you try items on before you buy them, to ensure they are the appropriate size. This option is available in the majority of high street stores. Of course, if you are shopping online, this can be a problem. The best thing to do is check any relevant conversion figures if you are unsure of what the size means. Don’t just take a guess! As well as this, be familiar with the online store’s return policy. Never buy before trying if there is no option to return the products.',\n",

Their garments are generally very loose and flowing. But this clothing completely reflects on the conservative style of dressing of Islam. Some of the traditional and conservative style of dressing is where men wear an ankle-length shirt woven from wool or cotton, which is called a thawb and along with this goes a shimagh, which is the chequered kind of turban that one will notice. For some other cold and chilly days they generally go in for a camel-hair cloak, which is known as bisht over the top. On the other hand the women clothing is considered to be something that is more colourful and a lot more traditional. The women's clothing comprises of a lot of tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliqués.Some of the other rituals that they have to follow are wearing a 'burkha', which is like a long cloak and a veil. This is worn in order to protect their modesty. However, this law is followed only by Arabs in the country it is not necessarily followed by any foreigners who enter Saudi Arabia. So if you are not an Arab then you are definitely free to roam in your usual clothing.\",\n",
